Create: Encapsulated overhauls Cobblemon's crafting recipes to be better integrated within the Create mod's progression system. This mod features Poke Ball crafting via lids and Sequential Assembly, as well as a new item system: Paint. Paints are based on the 16 available dyes in Minecraft, but now interchangeable between liquid and portable bottled form.

Every single medicine item (Potions, Status Heals, etc) now have their own liquid form and associated mixing recipes.

There are also Miscellaneous Create recipes for various Cobblemon items
